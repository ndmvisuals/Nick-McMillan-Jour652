      <p>With her back to the crowd, Hurunnessa Fariad stood with her arms in the ready position. In front of her were members of her mosque youth choir, ADAMS Beat, along with singers from the St. Francis International School Youth Choir. They had been invited to sing at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for an anti-bullying campaign. With a sweeping gesture of her hand, around 50 young voices broke into song. Their performance of “Salam Alaikum,” which in Arabic means “peace be upon you,” came with a twist. As the chorus repeated for a second time, the lyrics were sung in Hebrew, and the third time around they were sung in Spanish. All the while, the youth choirs were signing in American Sign Language.  </p>


       <p>This dedication to inclusivity is what defines Fariad, 42, who plays a myriad of roles in the interfaith community in D.C. She is the head of outreach and interfaith at All Dulles Area Muslim Society, one of the largest mosques in the United States, located in Sterling, Virginia. </p>

        <p>In 1983, when a 5 year-old Fariad stepped off the plane into the streets of New York, the first thing she noticed was the absence of dust. Compared to Pakistan, where she and her family had been seeking shelter as refugees from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, this was a completely different world. </p>

        <p>As the snow gently covered the streets outside her house in Queens, she was confused but enthralled by the glowing balls of light that adorned every house. A thousand questions sprang to mind. </p>

        <p>What is Christmas? What is Christianty? Who are these people?</p>

        <p>She soon realized that she was different from her kindergarten classmates. She was Muslim-American.  And even though she didn’t celebrate Christmas, she loved to learn about the different festivities, cultures and religions that surrounded her.</p>

        <p>Through talks with her father and siblings, she learned that there were people of other faiths here. Her dad explained how America is a place for people of all different backgrounds, a place where people come for refuge, and most importantly, that this is a place where everyone and anyone can come for a better life. </p>

        <p>Her father, who only received up to a 6th grade education, also introduced her to music through his poetry and constant singing. Throughout her K-12 education, Fariad sang in a choir. For high school, she applied to a performing arts school outside of her zone, and there received professional musical training. </p>

        <p>However, at university, she studied English and education. She never thought she would find a use for her musical background. </p>

        <p>In June of 2015, Fariad was suddenly called into the office of Imam Magid, the Executive Imam of ADAMS, where she was working as vice principal at the time.</p>

        <p>“I have a question for you,” Imam Magid said. “So I hear you have a music background?”</p>

        <p>Fariad was nervous and didn’t know what answer he was looking for. Some Muslim scholars frown upon music, which is not typically part of prayer service. “Am I in trouble?” she thought. </p>

        <p>
          “Yes, I am a trained vocalist,” Fariad said cautiously. Imam Magid slammed his hand on the table.
        </p>

        <p>“That’s it!” he said with an elated grin. “You’re going to start the first mosque youth choir!”</p>

        <p>Fariad laughed, thinking he was joking. But Imam Magid was serious. After realizing that there were no Muslim kids singing at events, he saw the need for a choir at the mosque. </p>

        <p>“If anyone gives you a hard time about it, send them to me,” Imam Magid told Fariad.</p>

        <p>It took a while to figure out the details, but on March 1 of 2016, Fariad led the inaugural practice of the nation's first mosque youth choir. </p>

        <p>Initially, Fariad thought they would sing at an ADAMS fundraising dinner once a year along with sporadic additional performances. But suddenly, they were being invited to sing at churches, synagogues, the Climate Change March, and Black Lives Matter protests. </p>

        <p>“They’ve really taken shape of what it means to do advocacy work, what it means to be a Muslim ambassador,” said Fariad. </p>

        <p>As choir director of the group, Fariad wants to show her singers how to use music as a platform to advocate for peace,  love, and  respect for all human beings. Through music, she is teaching her kids how to build their self confidence as American Muslims, and how to be ambassadors of the American Muslim community to the outside world. </p>

        <p>Having experienced discrimination for being Muslim-American, Fariad knows the importance of these lessons that she teaches through music and advocacy work.</p>

        <p>Two years after 9/11, Fariad started packing up to move to Florida to wait out the declining economy. She had just recently started wearing hijab in 1997, which was her freshman year of college. </p>

        <p>A ring of the doorbell interrupted her packing.</p>

        <p>At the door stood a group of officers from the NYPD & FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force, coming to check on a notice they received from a neighbor who said there was suspicious activity happening in the house. After a barrage of questions that left Fariad extremely shaken and traumatized, they left. Incidents like this one drive Fariad to create strong interfaith relations in the communities that she works in.  </p>

        <p>One parent told Fariad that being part of ADAMS Beat has helped their daughter’s self esteem, and that she is now proud to stand onstage in hijab singing in front of people.</p>

        <p>“It really takes a lot of people who haven’t been around Muslims to really see us in a different light, that we are part of the American fabric, that we do love this country, that we’re as American as anybody else,” said Fariad. </p>

        <p>This love for the U.S. that the American-Muslim community holds even amid rampant Islamophobia amazes Becca Pugh, who works with Fariad through Peace Catalyst International. </p>

        <p>PCI is a evangelical Christian group that aims to bring Christians and Muslim communities together to create safe and vibrant interfaith communities with the goal of eradicating Islamophobia. Pugh says that they aim to foster genuine relationships without the need to convert one another. </p>

        <p>The first collaboration between Pugh and Fariad was a panel discussion about Maryam (Mary), mother of Isa (Jesus). It was hosted at ADAMS mosque and featured Muslim and Christian speakers and audience members.</p>

        <p>After the event ended, Pugh remembers how Fariad walked her to the car and gave a big hug. With a warm smile, Fariad expressed how excited she was to continue working together to bring their two communities together. </p>

        <p>“This is not just a woman who’s doing her job,” said Pugh. “This is a person who cares deeply about people coming together across difference[s] and building friendships and having respect for each other.”</p>

        <p>Outside of her work with ADAMS mosque and PCI, Fariad hosts a multifaith podcast called Sisters Act. </p>

        <p>“A lot of times it’s just men talking, regardless of whether Christian, Muslim, or Jewish,” Fariad said. And in order to make sure she had a seat at the table, she made her own space for women of faith. She is joined by Dr. Sabrina Den, a Christian scholar, and Rabbi Susan Shankman. </p>

        <p>Shankman has been the Rabbi at Washington Hebrew Congregation in D.C. for the past 20 years, and got to know Fariad through the multiple interfaith events that they have put on in the past. She remembers there being an instant connection and was excited when Fariad invited her to join.</p>

        <p>Together, the three of them talk about how life, faith and resilience affects them as women. They have a fun and lively energy, and they aren't afraid to tackle difficult topics such as race in America, allyship, and women’s rights. </p>

        <p>The pandemic has moved their recording sessions to Zoom, where they virtually host their episodes. Shankman remembers noticing a beautifully painted white dresser in the background of Fariad’s room that she had made over from its original drab brown state. </p>

        <p>“It sort of embodied, for me, who she is,” said Shankman. “Life can be challenging at moments, and it’s up to us to take what life gives us and turn it into something beautiful … She finds these opportunities and moments to bring people together of different backgrounds and find that beauty and harness that for [a] positive tomorrow.”</p>

        <p>Even though the COVID pandemic has changed the landscape of interfaith work , Fariad isn’t backing down. ADAMS Beat can’t currently sing together in big venues, but they still meet every Wednesday to practice on Zoom. The success of the choir’s smooth transition to online operations is a testament to Fariad’s persistence and determination to achieve her cause. Once the pandemic has abated, Fariad will doubtless be back on stage at the Kennedy Center, spreading love and tolerance through music with ADAMS Beat.</p>
